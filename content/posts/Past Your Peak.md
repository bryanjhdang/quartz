*Past Your Peak* was made for the [Mountain Top Game Jam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/mountain-top-game-jam-2023), which was hosted by the SFU Game Development club. In fact, it was my first game jam that I did with a group of friends in a team of 6. It was a 24-hour long jam, and by the end of it, while our eyes were about to shut and our bodies felt like keeling over, we had a completed project we were proud of.

Early on, we decided on a theme: a **reverse rogue-like**.

Wouldn't it be fun if you started off immensely powerful and stomping every enemy, but as time went on, you struggled to survive as you got weaker? This was the driving idea behind our project, but it wasn't long before we ran into issues...

### Problem #1 -- Where's our Leader?

The first problem arose when I took a break from spriting the main character and enemies, and decided to ask around how far everyone got on their work. It turns out that a lot of the requirements we listed at the beginning of the jam had gotten misintepreted, with a few members developing different mechanics than we discussed. We quickly decided that we needed someone to call the shots, and so we had one of our members just rapid-fire out instructions, which led us back on the right path.

### Problem #2 -- I'm so Tired

Our biggest mistake was telling ourselves that we were going to pull an all-nighter to get this project done, instead of making sure the scope would allow us to get some sleep. Near the 5 AM mark (the deadline was around 8 AM), productivity went down the drain as everyone was starting to get tired. Lesson learned -- *I'm not staying up again*.

### Takeaways

Overall, this game jam was a fun lesson in learning how to work in a big group (well, big for a small project like this), and also polishing up my art and programming skills. I didn't get to do anything too fancy besides spriting and writing several enemy AI behaviours like chase the player around, aggro, etc., but I would definitely consider doing a game jam again.
