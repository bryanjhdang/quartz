> Worked on a **C++ Qt-based** desktop application UI for a node-based configurable robot. My work included creating node configuration menus, an Undo system, and extensive bug fixing. I worked closely with the UX designer to turn Figma designs into a usable UI along with **HTML and CSS**, and communicated with the backend team for requested features and **protobuf** for data storage and retrieval.
