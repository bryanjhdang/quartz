Hey there, I'm Bryan. This is my little place on the Internet where I show off my personal projects, professional experience, blog posts, and much more -- make yourself at home!

I live in Vancouver BC, and am currently attending SFU as a Software Systems major (think of it as Computer Science, but with a higher focus on practical projects). I'm passionate about making fun stuff, whether that's games, tools for my TTRPG sessions, or just something that's plain cool.

### Not sure where to go?

I'd recommend starting off with seeing my latest blog post on [x], or checking out some of my project listed here!
