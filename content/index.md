Hi there!

My name is Bryan, and this is my little place on the Internet where I show off my personal projects, blog posts, and much more -- make yourself at home.

I live in Vancouver BC, and am currently attending SFU as a [Software Systems](https://www.sfu.ca/computing/prospective-students/undergraduate-students/programs/degree-programs/softwaresystems.html) major (think of it as Computer Science, but with a higher focus on projects). I'm passionate about making fun stuff, whether that's games, tools for my TTRPG sessions, or something that's just plain cool.

#### My goals for this semester are:
- [ ] Create an award determiner for *SystemsHacks 2024*, a Software Systems hackathon
- [ ] Create a grid-based puzzle game in Unity
- [ ] Create a *Dungeons & Dragons* helper mobile app
- [ ] Create a time tracking study web app

#### *Not sure where to look first?* Check out:
- My [blog posts](/posts/), where I post my thoughts on experiences and projects.
- My [projects](/projects), showcasing everything I've worked on.
