Hi there! 

My name is Bryan, and this is my little place on the Internet where I show off my personal projects, professional experience, blog posts, and much more -- make yourself at home!

I live in Vancouver BC, and am currently attending SFU as a [Software Systems](https://www.sfu.ca/computing/prospective-students/undergraduate-students/programs/degree-programs/softwaresystems.html) major (think of it as Computer Science, but with a higher focus on hands-on projects). I'm passionate about making fun stuff, whether that's games, tools for my TTRPG sessions, or just something that's plain cool.

*Not sure where to look first?* Check out:
- My latest [blog posts](/posts/Past%20Your%20Peak.md), where I post my thoughts on experiences and projects.
- My [projects](/projects), showcasing everything I've worked on.
