Hey there, I'm Bryan. This is my little place on the Internet where I show off my personal projects, professional experience, blog posts, and much more -- make yourself at home!

Currently, I am working on a *Study Buddy* app that tracks how long you study and adds a Tamogatchi-esque creature to help keep you accountable (it's in the works!).

### Not sure where to go?

I'd recommend starting off with seeing my latest blog post on [x], or checking out some of my project listed here!
